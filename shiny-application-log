Steps:
1. Connect to instance
2. In the Terminal application type "sudo nano /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf" and press "Enter"
3. Type "preserve_logs true;" directly beneath "run_as shiny;"
	- Enables the Shiny Server to store logs of applicaiton usage
	- Make no other changes
4. Press "ctrl + shift + x" simultaneously
5. Type "Y" in response to "Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES)?"
6. Press "Enter"
7. Restart Shiny Server:
	a. Type "sudo systemctl stop shiny-server" and press "Enter"
	b. Type "sudo systemctl start shiny-server" and press "Enter"
8. Attempt to access your application online by typing "[IPv4 Public IP]:3838/[Application's directory name]/"
9. Type "ls /var/log/shiny-server"
	- One of the results is a .log file that documents why your application crashed
	- Copy the relevant file's name (they are named and time stamped)
10. Type "sudo cat /var/log/shiny-server/[paste .log file name]"
	- An RStudio console-like result will be shown.
11. Repeat steps 8 through 10 (inclusive) until problem is resolved.
	- See adding-r-packages tutorial for adding R packages to your Shiny Server Environment
12. Type "sudo nano /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf" and press "Enter"
13. Delete "preserve_logs true;"

Notes:
a) Use this process to resolve application crashes by tracking an application's function.
