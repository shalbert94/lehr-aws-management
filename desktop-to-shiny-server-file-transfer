Steps:
1. Open the Terminal application
2. Type "ssh localhost" and press "Enter"
3. Type your desktop account's password and press "Enter"
4. Type scp -i [key pair file path] [file to be transferred's file path] [username of the instance who will recieve the file]:[where transferred file should be stored] and press "Enter"
  a. If you are transferring a directory (i.e. a folder containing files) type "-r" between "scp" and "-i"
  b. Key pair file path cannot be written with quotation marks, like when you connect to the instance. Write the entire file path.
  c. The instance's username can be extracted by:
      i.    Enter AWS console
      ii.   Select your instance
      iii.  Click "Connect"
      iv.   Beneath "Example", copy the section starting with "ubuntu@"
            (E.g. "ubuntu@ec2-36-157-184-27.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com")
  d. Do not forget to add ":"
  e. Type "~/"
  f. Press "Enter"
     The file/directory is now stored on the AWS Instance, not the Shiny Server
5. Connect to the instance
6. Type "sudo mv ~/[file that was transferred to instance] /srv/shiny-server" and press "Enter"
7. Type "sudo chmod 777 /srv/shiny-server/[name of your shiny application's main folder]/shiny.sh"
8. Type "sudo nano /etc/crontab"
9. Type "*  *   * * *   root   /srv/shiny-server/[name of your shiny application's main folder]/shiny.sh" above the "#" symbol located at the bottom
10. Press "Ctrl" + "Shift" + "X" simultanously
11. Type "Y"
12. Press "Enter"
13. Restart Shiny Server
	a. Type "sudo systemctl stop shiny-server" and press "Enter"
	b. Type "sudo systemctl start shiny-server" and press "Enter"
	c. Type "sudo systemctl status shiny-server" and press "Enter"
	d. Type "q" to exit status information
14. Attempt to access your application online by typing "[IPv4 Public IP]:3838/[Application's directory name]/app_1/"
	Likely, the R application that was added to the Shiny Server cannot be run because packages it requires haven't been installed.
	To see a log of the new application which is similar to what you see in RStudio's console when an application crashes, please see that explanation.
	You type "app_1" in the address bar in order to test whether the app can work. This is because the main folder only directs a user to an application, while app_1 or any other number is a folder containing your shiny application

Notes:
a) Any directory added to /srv/shiny-server which contains a ui.R and server.R file will automatically run after being added and the shiny server was restarted
b) IPv4 Public IP can be found in your EC2 console
