Determine the maximum number of individuals you expect to be reviewing your application at a single moment (10 should be plenty)
Create the same number of copies of your shiny application 
Rename the copies "app_#", where # represents a number starting from 1. Make sure not to skip numbers and to give each copy a different number.
  E.g. app_1, app_2, app_3, app_4, etc.
Create directory that has the name of the shiny application you created copies of, 
Place every copy in that directory
Download the files index.html and shiny.sh from this github repository
Place both of those files into the directory containing copies of your application
Open shiny.sh in a text editor application and on the second line (it says "dir_apps='/srv/shiny-server/myApp/'") replace "myApp" with the name of your directory containing the application's copies.
Save the shiny.sh file's changes

Note:
a. The reason you create copies of your application and place shiny.sh and index.html into a directory is to enable a load blancer to function. The load balancer enables your application to be used by more than one person at a time.
