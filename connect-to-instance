Steps:
1. Open "Files" application on desktop
2. Locate the key pair associated with the instance you want to connect with
	Feel free to move the key pair to another folder
3. Open "Terminal" application on desktop
4. Type "chmod 400 [path to file]"
	Path to file can be found by right-clicking the key pair file in Files and clicking "copy"
	Paste the file path into your terminal and edit it according to the following example
	Example of a file path: [Pasted] file:///home/folder1/child1folder1/keypairfile.pem
													[Edited] /home/folder1/child1folder1/keypairfile.pem
5. Enter the AWS console
6. Select an instance
7. Click "Connect"
8. For "I would like to connect with" select "A standalone SSH client"
9. Depending on where your key pair file is located...
	i.  If it's in your "home" folder:
		a. Copy the "Example" text shown
			(E.g. ssh -i "keypair.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-156-184-27.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
		b. Paste the text into your Terminal
	ii. If it's anywhere else:
		a. Copy the "Example" text shown
		b. Paste the text into your Terminal
		c. Replace "keypair.pem" with its file path
			(


Notes:
a) "chmod400" changes the key pair's access permissions. This step is necessary.
