Notes:
a) Another note describes how to enter the console.
b) Clicking "Review and Launch" results in your instance having default settings.
c) Do not worry about whether the free tier will be powerful enough to compute your model, it's easy to upgrade later.
d) I advise creating a billing alert for every instance immediately after they are created.
