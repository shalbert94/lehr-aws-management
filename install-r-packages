Steps:
1. Connect to instance
2. Access the Shiny Server directly:
	i. Create a password (only necessary once):
		a. Type "sudo passwd shiny" into the Terminal and press "Enter"
		b. Enter a password and press "Enter"
			Make sure to save it!
		c. Retype the password and press "Enter"
	ii. Login to Shiny Server:
		a. Type "su - shiny" and press "Enter"
		b. Type the Shiny password created in step #2i
		c. Type "R"
			Opens the R console
		d. Install packages by typing as you do in the RStudio console
			(I.e. install.packages("[package name]")


Note: If you are resolving a crashing app, I suggest opening two Terminal windows. One should disply the R console (reached in this 
tutorial) and the other should show the application log (shown in "shiny-application-log" tutorial).
